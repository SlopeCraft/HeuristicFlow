/**
 * \ingroup HEU_GENETIC
 * \class SOGA
 * \brief Single-object genetic solver.
 *
 * \tparam Var_t  Type of decisition variable.
 * \tparam fOpt Whether greater fitness value means better. SOGA will always try to find the best, so it's vital to
 * tell SOGA which direction is right.
 * \tparam Record  Whether the solver records fitness changelog.
 * \tparam Args_t  Type of other parameters.
 * \tparam _iFun_ Function to initialize an individual in population. This function will be called only when
 * initializing. Use nullptr if you hope to determine it at runtime. nullptr as default value.
 * \tparam _fFun_ Funtion to compute fitness for any
 * individual. Use nullptr if you hope to determine it at runtime. nullptr as default value.
 * \tparam _cFun_ Function to apply crossover. Use
 * nullptr if you hope to determine it at runtime. nullptr as default value.
 * \tparam _mFun_ Function to apply mutation. Use nullptr if you hope to
 * determine it at runtime. nullptr as default value.
 *
 *
 * \note `Arg_t` is a pseudo-global variable for solvers. It's not global variables because it's stored as a member of
 * solver, thus if in some special conditions you have to run multiple solvers, each solver has its own gloabl
 * variable. It can be any type about the problem you are solving. For constrainted problems, it can be a box-constraint
 * type; for TSP problems, it can be the distance matrix; and even for GA-BP or PSO-BP, it can be your data set. If you
 * don't need it, use `void` and it will disapper.
 *
 * Usually there are five main procedures in GA :
 * 1. initialization : Filling all decision variables in the population with random initial values.
 * 2. computing fitness : Go through the whole population and compute each's fitness value.
 * 3. selection : Eliminate some relatively bad inidividual sothat the size of population can decline to
 * `populationSize` assigned in the `GAOption`.
 * 4. crossover Randomly pick individuals in pairs as parents and create pairs of child inidividuals. The childern will
 * be inserted into the original population.
 * 5. mutation Randomly pick individuals and change their values slightly. This procedure doesn't change the value
 * inplace, but insert the modified value into the population.
 *
 * The 1,2,4,5 each corresponds to a function representively, called initialization function(iFun), fitness
 * function(fFun), crossover function(cFun), mutation function(mFun). These functions can be assigned either at compile
 * time or runtime.
 *
 * APIs of SOGA are implemented sperately in many internal base classes, and they are organized through public
 * inheriting.
 *
 * ## APIs that **all** genetic solvers have:
 * - `void setOption(const GAOption&)` sets the option of solver.
 * - `void initializePop()` that initialized the population.
 * - `void run()` runs the genetic algorithm.
 * - `Fitness_t bestFitness() const` returns the fitness of best solution in current population.
 * - `size_t generation() const` returns the generation that solvers has passed.
 * - `size_t failTimes() const` returns the fail times of current population.
 * - `const std::list<Gene> & population() const` returns a const-reference to the population.
 * - `const GAOption & option() const` returns a const-reference to the GAOption of solver.
 * - `typename solver_t::initializeFun` is the type of iFuns
 * - `typename solver_t::fitnessFun` is the type of fFuns
 * - `typename solver_t::crossoverFun` is the type of cFuns
 * - `typename solver_t::mutateFun` is the type of mFuns
 * - `initializeFun iFun() const` returns the initialization function.
 * - `fitnessFun fFun() const` returns the fitness function.
 * - `crossoverFun cFun() const` returns the crossover function.
 * - `mutateFun mFun() const` returns the mutation function.
 *
 *
 * ## APIs that all genetic solvers whose `Args_t` is not `void` have:
 * - `const Arg_t & args() const` returns a const-reference of args.
 * - `void setArgs(const Arg_t &)` set the value of args.
 *
 * ## APIs that all genetic solvers with recording have:
 * - `const std::vector<Fitness_t> & record() const` returns a const reference to the recoding.
 *
 *
 * ## APIs that SOGA solvers have:
 * - `const Var_t& result() const` returns a const-reference the the final result decision variable.
